The infographic analyzes:
Historical Timeline: Tracking the number of women MPs from the 1st Parliament to the 7th Parliament (2016), showing a gradual increase from 7 women (out of 129 members) in 1979 to 36 women (out of 275 members) in 2016.
Regional Representation: Breaking down female representatives across all 16 regions of Ghana, with Greater Accra leading in female representation.
Party Representation: Examining how the NDC and NPP, Ghana's dominant parties, compare in terms of female candidates elected.
The Need for Women in Power: Highlighting the importance of gender equality in political decision-making.

Background:
Crew's Cup underwent ownership changes, leading to customer churn rates of 70% annually. Through strategic interventions including the return of popular instructors and positive media coverage, churn was reduced to 60%. This analysis examines how to further improve retention.

Five-Factor Commitment Model:
1. Economic Commitment: Loyalty driven by benefits gained from being a customer
2. Forced Commitment: When customers feel compelled to stay due to external pressures
3. Habitual Commitment: Routine-based loyalty from consistent usage patterns
4. Normative Commitment: Moral or values-based connection to the brand
5. Affective Commitment: Emotional attachment and genuine love for the brand

Investment Options Analyzed:
- Monk's Strategy: Addressing normative commitment through brand values
- Proposed Subscription: Economic commitment through stable pricing
- Instructor's New Product: Reducing forced commitment through variety

Recommendation: Implement the Monk's Strategy focusing on normative commitment, as it encourages loyalty based on values rather than just personal benefit, creating more sustainable customer relationships.
